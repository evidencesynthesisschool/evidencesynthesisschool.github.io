                            Dr. María D. López Rodríguez is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Almería (Spain) in the <a href="https://www.ual.es/investigacion/investiga/grupos/area/grupo/SEJ/SEJ419" target="_blank">Research Group of Applied Sociology</a>. Her main area of work is focused on conducting transdisciplinary science and participatory action-research to bridge the links between science and other parts of society in order to support sustainability transformations in different cultural, social and institutional frameworks. She is especially interested in examining elements and methodological pathways that may (or may not) act as driving forces for activating cooperative action behaviours for sustainability transformations, especially between scientists and non-scientists. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MAXnYvkAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Her work</a> includes a wide variety of research publications, including articles in indexed journals, books, book chapters, and outreach publications. She has led and conducted numerous knowledge co-production workshops in diverse countries to translate scientific outcomes to policy and society. Her research has produced relevant scientific contributions while achieving instrumental impacts on policy and society. She is part of the relevant global scientific network "<a href="https://pecs-science.org/" target="_blank">the Program on Ecosystem Change and Society</a>" and other networks at local and national levels focused on facilitating scientific knowledge to drive societal learning and policy changes to advance towards sustainability.<br>

                            Dr José Luis Vicente Vicente is a postdoctoral researcher at ZALF (Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research) currently focused on assessing the socio-ecological impacts from the implementation of food initiatives aiming at transforming the agri-food system. Currently he develops his work within the EU project <a href="https://foodshift2030.eu/" target="_blank">FoodSHIFT2030</a>, where he assesses the impacts of regional agroecology-based food hubs in the city of Berlin. During his career he has worked on mitigation and adaptation to climate change in agriculture, specialising in biogeochemistry of agroecosystems. Because of this, he has participated as an expert reviewer in a number of IPCC reports. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jose-Vicente-Vicente" target="_blank">José Luis’ work</a> has also focused on evidence synthesis research projects, including leading a number of meta-analyses and systematic reviews on the topic.<br>
